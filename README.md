# AA Skyview Shuttle

Unofficial web app displaying American Airlines employee shuttle schedules between DFW Airport and off-site locations (Flight Academy & The Landing).
matically sets the last updated date on page load

HTML:
✅ Footer addition: Added "Schedule data last updated: [date]" line
✅ Dynamic display: Uses <span id="last-updated-date"> for JavaScript injection

CSS:
✅ Smaller text: Made the last updated line smaller and lighter color
✅ Subtle styling: Gray color and smaller font to be informative but not prominent

Result:
The footer now shows:

Line 1: "Unofficial website - Official schedule data. Times in local timezone."
Line 2: "Schedule data last updated: August 12, 2025" (in smaller, gray text)
This gives users transparency about when the schedule information was last updated, which is important for an unofficial website displaying official schedule data. The date is easy to update in the JavaScript constant when new schedule data becomes available.
